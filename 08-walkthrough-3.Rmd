# Background

One area of interest is the delivery of online instruction, which is becoming more prevalent: in 2007, over 3.9 million U.S. students were enrolled one or more online courses (Allen & Seaman, 2008). 

In this walkthrough, we examine the educational experiences of students in online science courses at a virtual middle school in order to characterize their motivation to achieve and their tangible engagement with the course in terms of behavioral trace measures. To do so, we use a robust data set, which includes self-reported motivation as well as behavioral trace data collected from a learning management system (LMS) to identify predictors of final course grade. Our work examines the idea of educational success in terms of student interactions with an online science course.

One meaningful perspective from which to consider students' engagement with online courses is related to their motivation to achieve. More specifically, it is important to consider how and why students are engaging with the course. Considering the psychological mechanisms behind achievement is valuable because doing so may help to identify meaningful points of intervention for educators and for researchers and administrators in online *and* face-to-face courses interested in the intersection between behavioral trace measures and students' motivational and affective experiences in such courses.

We take up the following four questions:

1. Is motivation more predictive of course grades as compared to other online indicators of engagement?
2. Which types of motivation are most predictive of achievement?
3. Which types of trace measures are most predictive of achievement?
4. How does a random forest compare to a simple linear model (regression)?

# Information about the dataset 

This dataset came from 499 students enrolled in online middle school science courses in 2015-2016. The data were originally collected for use as a part of a research study, though the findings have not been published anywhere, yet.

The setting of this study was a public, provider of individual online courses in a Midwestern state. In particular, the context was two semesters (Fall and Spring) of offerings of five online science courses (Anatomy & Physiology, Forensic Science, Oceanography, Physics, and Biology), with a total of 36 classes. 

Specific information in the dataset included:

- a pre-course survey students completed about their self-reported motivation in science — in particular, their perceived competence, utility value, and interest
- the time students spent on the course (obtained from the LMS, Blackboard) and their final course grades as well as their involvement in discussion forums
- for discussion board responses, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan, & Blackburn, 2015) to calculate the number of posts per student and variables for the mean levels of students' cognitive processing, positive affect, negative affect, and social-related discourse

At the beginning of the semester, students were asked to complete the pre-course survey about their perceived competence, utility value, and interest. At the end of the semester, the time students spent on the course, their final course grades, and the contents of the discussion forums were collected.

In this walkthrough, we used the R package **caret** to carry out the analyses.

# Information on random forests

500 trees were grown as part of our random forest. We partitioned the data before conducting the main analysis so that neither the training nor the testing data set would be disproportionately representative of high-achieving or low-achieving students. The training data set consisted of 80% of the original data (n = 400 cases), whereas the testing data set consisted of 20% of the original data (n = 99 cases). We built our random forest model on the training data set, and then evaluated the model on the testing data set. Three variables were tried at each node.

Note that the random forest algorithm does not accept cases with missing data, and so we deleted cases listwise if data were missing. This decision eliminated 51 cases from our original data set, to bring us to our final sample size of 499 unique students.

For our analyses, we used Random Forest modeling (Breiman, 2001). Random forest is an extension of decision tree modeling, whereby a collection of decision trees are simultaneously "grown" and are evaluated based on out-of-sample predictive accuracy (Breiman, 2001).  Random forest is random in two main ways: first, each tree is only allowed to "see" and split on a limited number of predictors instead of all the predictors in the parameter space; second, a random subsample of the data is used to grow each individual tree, such that no individual case is weighted too heavily in the final prediction.

Whereas some machine learning approaches (e.g., boosted trees) would utilize an iterative model-building approach, random forest estimates all the decision trees at once. In this way, each tree is independent of every other tree. Thus, the random forest algorithm provides a robust regression approach that is distinct from other modeling approaches. The final random forest model aggregates the findings across all the separate trees in the forest in order to offer a collection of "most important" variables as well as a percent variance explained for the final model.

A random forest is well suited to the research questions that we had here because it allows for nonlinear modeling. We hypothesized complex relationships between students' motivation, their engagement with the online courses, and their achievement. For this reason, a traditional regressive or structural equation model would have been insufficient to model the parameter space we were interesting in modeling. Our random forest model had one outcome and eleven predictors. A common tuning parameter for machine learning models is the number of variables considered at each split (Kuhn, 2008); we considered three variables at each split for this analysis.  

The outcome was the final course grade that the student earned. The predictor variables included motivation variables (interest value, utility value, and science perceived competence) and trace variables (the amount of time spent in the course, the course name, the number of discussion board posts over the course of the semester, the mean level of cognitive processing evident in discussion board posts, the positive affect evident in discussion board posts, the negative affect evident in discussion board posts, and the social-related discourse evident in their discussion board posts). We used this random forest model to address all three of our research questions.

To interpret our findings, we examined three main things: (1) predictive accuracy of the random forest model, (2) variable importance, and (3) variance explained by the final random forest model.

# Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(here)
```

First, we will load the data, *filter* the data to include only the data from one year, and *select* variables of interest.

```{r}
f <- here::here("online-science-motivation-w-disc.csv")

d <- read_csv(f)

d <-d %>% filter(!str_detect(course_ID, "S217"))

d <- d %>% 
    select(pre_int, pre_uv,  pre_percomp, time_spent,course_ID, final_grade, subject, enrollment_reason, semester, enrollment_status, cogproc, social, posemo, negemo, n)
```

## Use of caret

Here, we remove observations with missing data (per our note above about random forests requiring complete cases).

```{r}
nrow(d)
d <- na.omit(d)
nrow(d)
```

First, machine learning methods often involve using a large number of variables. Oftentimes, some of these variables will not be suitable to use: they may be highly correlated with other variables, for instance, or may have very little - or no - variability. Indeed, for the data set used in this study, one variables has the same (character string) value for all of the observations. We can detect this variable and any others using the following function:

```{r}
nearZeroVar(d, saveMetrics = TRUE)
```

If we look at `enrollment_status`, we will see that it is "Approved/Enrolled" for *all* of the students. When we use this in certian models, t may cause some problems, and so we remove it first.

```{r}
d <- select(d, -enrollment_status)
```

Note that many times you may wish to pre-process the variables, such as by centering or scaling them; we could this with code like the following, which is not run here, as we will first try this out with the variables' original values.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d <- mutate_if(d, 
               is.numeric, scale)
```

Now, we will prepare the **train** and **test** datasets, using the caret function for creating data partitions. Here, the **p** argument specifies what proportion of the data we want to be in the **training** partition. Note that this function splits the data based upon the outcome, so that the training and test data sets will both have comparable values for the outcome. Note the `times = 1` argument; this function can be used to create *multiple* train and test sets, something we will describe in more detail later.

```{r}
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(d$final_grade,
                                  p = .8, 
                                  list = FALSE,
                                  times = 1)

d_train <- d[ trainIndex,] # can we make this tidy?
d_test <- d[-trainIndex,]
```

Let's turn all of the character variables into factors. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d_test <- d_test %>%
    mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)

d_train <- d_train %>%
    mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
```

Finally, we will estimate the models.

Here, we will use the train function, passing *all* of the variables in the data frame (except for the outcome, or dependent variable, `final_grade`) as predictors. NOte that you can read more about the specific random forest implementation chosen [here](http://topepo.github.io/caret/train-models-by-tag.html#random-forest).

```{r}
rf_fit <- train(final_grade ~ .,
                data = d_train,
                method = "ranger")

rf_fit
```

We have some results! First, we see that we have 400 samples, or 400 observations, the number in the train data set. No pre-processing steps were specified in the model fitting (note that) these the output of `preProcess` can be passed to `train()` to center, scale, and transform the data in many other ways. Next, note that a resampling technique has been used: this is not for validating the model (per se), but is rather for selecting tuning parameters, or options that need to be specified as a part of the modeling. These parameters can be manually provided, or can be estimated via strategies such as the bootstrap resample (or *k*-folds cross validation).

It appears that the model with the value of the **mtry** tuning parameter equal to 42 seemed to explain the data best, the **splirule* being "extratrees", and **min.node.size** held constant at a value of 5. 

Let's see if we end up with slightly different values if we change the resampling technique to cross-validation, instead of bootstrap resampling.

```{r}
train_control <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                              number = 10,
                              repeats = 10)

rf_fit1 <- train(final_grade ~ .,
                data = d_train,
                method = "ranger",
                trControl = train_control)

rf_fit1
```

The same tuning parameter values seem to be found with this method. Let's check just one last thing - what if we do not fix **min.node.size** to five?

Let's create our own grid of values to test. We'll stick with the default bootstrap resampling method to choose the best model.

```{r}
tune_grid <- expand.grid(mtry = c(2, 22, 42),
                         splitrule = c("variance", "extratrees"),
                         min.node.size = c(1, 5, 10, 15, 20))

rf_fit2 <- train(final_grade ~ .,
                data = d_train,
                method = "ranger",
                tuneGrid = tune_grid)

rf_fit2
```

The model with the same values as identified before but with **min.node.size** equal to 1 seems to fit best, though the improvement seems to be fairly small relative to the difference the other tuning parameters seem to make. 

Let's take a look at this model. We will first note the large number of independent variables: this is due to the factors being treated as dummy codes. We can also note the *OOB prediction error (MSE)`, of 0.351, and the proportion of the variance explained, or R squared, of 0.658.

```{r}
rf_fit2$finalModel
```

Things to do next...

- see how predicted values compare to those in the test set to understand predictive accuracy
- examine variable importance
- compare predictive accuracy of the model to a linear model (regression)

<!-- # 3. RESULTS  -->

<!-- First, we assessed the model-based calculations specific to the data used to fit the model. Using the data in the training set (with *n* = 400 observations), we calculated the $R^2$ value, indicating the proportion of the variability in the outcome (final grade) accounted for by the nine predictor variables. The $R^2$ value was .528, which suggested that for this sample and partition of the data, just more than one-half of the variability in the outcome could be attributed to the predictors that were included. -->

<!-- In addition to using the training data set to calculate the $R^2$ value, as we used a training and a test (with *n* = 99 observations) data set, we were able to compare how well the model predicted the outcome, students' final grade. Thus, the predictive accuracy of our random forest model was assessed by examining the difference between the predicted values for the testing data set and the actual values. Using the 99 test set observations and their predictions, we calculated the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which was 12.70. Given that students' final grades were measured on a 0-100 scale, this represents, in substantive terms, modest - but not excellent - predictive accuracy (especially given that the *SD* for students' final grade in the test set was 19.50). -->

<!-- We also visually compared students' observed (or actual) and their predicted final grades, as in Figure 2. This helped us to see that while the model predicted the final grade accurately overall ($M_{\text{observed-final-grade}}$ = `r round(mean(data_test$final_grade), 3)`; $M_{\text{predicted-final-grade}}$ = `r round(mean(rf_pred), 3)`), the model predicted grades closer to the mean more frequently than as observed in the training data set and predicted very high grades less frequently than observed in the training data set. -->

<!-- Below, we will discuss in detail the specific findings for each of our research questions, which concern the variable importance plots. Variable importance plots are interpreted based on the incremental percent change in mean-squared-error (MSE) if a given variable is scrambled in the original data set (James, Witten, Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2013). In other words, variable importance plots help to answer the question: if a variable is scrambled so as not to relate to the outcome in any systematic way, how much does this randomization affect the mean squared error? If a variable's scrambling results in a large change in MSE, it is thought to be more important. -->

<!-- ## Results for Research Question 1 -->

<!-- Research question 1 asked whether motivation was a better predictor of achievement than behavioral engagement indicators. With respect to research question 1, the variable importance plot for final grade indicated that the change in mean squared error was more strongly affected by trace variables than motivation measures. The most predictive variable was the number of discussion posts, followed by the amount of time spent in the course. The course identifier, evidence for negative affect in the discussion posts, and level of cognitive processing associated with the discussion posts were the predictors that were next in terms of importance. All of these predictors were more important than all of the motivation variables. -->

<!-- ## Results for Research Question 2 -->

<!-- Research question 2 asked which of the motivation variables was most predictive of course achievement. As presented in Table 1, among motivation variables, utility value was most important, followed by perceived competence. Interest value was the least predictive of the motivation variables; indeed, interest value was the least predictive of all variables in the random forest model. -->

<!-- ## Results for Research Question 3 -->

<!-- Research question 3 asked which of the trace variables was most predictive of course achievement. The most predictive variable in terms of achievement was the number of posts in the discussion forums. Given its importance, we sought to explore how the strength of relation between students' predicted and observed final grade might vary as a function of the number of posts. We turned the number of posts into a categorical variable with three levels and examined whether the relationship between students' predicted and observed final grade appeared to differ. -->

<!-- ```{r, fig.cap = "Relationship between observed and predicted final grade (test set) by number of discussion forum posts"} -->
<!-- tp <- p %>% -->
<!--     select(final_grade, pred_final_grade, n) %>% -->
<!--     mutate(n_cat = case_when( -->
<!--         n < 17 ~ "<16",  -->
<!--         n >= 17 & n < 33 ~ "16-32", -->
<!--         n >= 33 ~ "33-49", -->
<!--         TRUE ~ as.character(n))) -->

<!--     theme_bw() + -->
<!--     ylab("Predicted Final Grade") + -->
<!--     xlab("Observed Final Grade") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- For the 99 observations in the test dataset, this figure revealed there to be a stronger relationship between the predicted and observed final grade for students who posted fewer times to the discussion forum. For students with the most posts (between 33 and 49), the relationship appeared to be nearly zero, suggesting that *other* (important) variables mattered more for these students (or that the model was predicting these students' final grades poorly, a postsibility given that the model appeared to predict the final grades of the students with the highest final grades poorly). -->

<!-- The number of posts to the discussion forum by students was the most predictive of all the variables in the model, followed by the time students spent on the course. After the course students were in (not considered a trace measure), the negative affect evidenced by students' discussion forum posts and the extent of the cognitive processing evidenced by them were the next most important. -->

<!-- # Results for RQ4 -->

<!-- <!-- Need to add! --> -->

<!-- rf_fit <- train(final_grade ~ pre_int + pre_uv + pre_percomp + time_spent + course_ID + cogproc + social + posemo + negemo + n, -->

<!--                 method = 'regression') -->

<!-- # 4. Discussion -->

<!-- Overall, our random forest model explained a large amount of the variance in achievement in this study (e.g., 55.49%). However, the predictive accuracy of the model might ideally be higher: the absolute value of the average difference between the predicted final grade and actual final grade was 11.8%. This discrepancy suggests that whereas our model did a good job at explaining variance in the outcome of achievement, it did not perform as well in its prediction of "unseen" test data as would be ideal. Future research should thus explore whether the predictive accuracy of the model could be further developed. Even so, our predictive accuracy is not so low as to be unhelpful. Rather, this study offers interesting insights as to the relative importance of motivation constructs and trace measures of engagement in terms of explanatory power in explaining middle school students' online science course grades. Surprisingly, we found that trace measures of engagement with a LMS were more predictive of student achievement than motivation variables. -->

<!-- ## Limitations -->

<!-- This study was limited in some important ways. First, we chose to  operationalize achievement as final course grade. This has strengths (it is easy to interpret and is somewhat comparable across courses, for example) but also some weaknesses. Future work could examine other meaningful outcomes - not only achievement-related outcomes. Additionally, we did not account for the number of discussion posts that were required in a given course and it is important that future research endeavor to explore whether this plays a role in predicting the outcome. Also, we while we used a fairly sophisticated machine learning modeling approach, there are some changes to how we could specify the final models: Namely, we could consider the number of variables considered at each split as a tuning parameter by consider a wider range of values: Some research has shown larger values to be associated with better fit (Kuhn, 2010.). Finally, and on a technical note, in order to better understand how successful the modeling strategy was, we may wish to explore not only the fit of the model in terms of the $R^2$ (for the training dataset) and the predictive accuracy (for the test dataset), but also the cross-validated fit of the model, which can be obtained by resampling or using *k*-folds cross-validation on the training dataset.  -->

<!-- ## Implications -->

<!-- As more K-12 courses move online, data will continue to accumulate at rapid rates. It is important that educators and administrators consider the implications of computer-mediated instruction. This study suggests that the measurement of students' engagement with courses is helpful in understanding their achievement in these courses. Trace data is valuable to collect and it could be valuable for educators to consider it more thoroughly. This study also offers implications in terms of the motivation constructs studied as part of learning analytics research, namely, that motivation as measured through self-report surveys seems to be important, but not as important as the behaviors reflected in the trace data generated by and collected through the LMS. The importance of the engagement with the course through discussion board posts in terms of predicting final grade suggests that perhaps it is valuable for students to post even if they are not intrinsically motivated to do so. Future research, them, could explore the complex relations between student motivation and course engagement, especially insofar as to examine characteristics of the online experience that could make these relations different than the patterns of relations that would be evident in a face-to-face classroom. -->
